DICOMTools.jl
-------------

Additional DICOM functionality build on top of [DICOM.jl](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/DICOM.jl)
More precisely, my fork [DICOM.jl](https://github.com/felixhorger/DICOM.jl), where I slightly changed the way data is read in.

Currently, this package grows as needed by my research, so comments and documentation are painfully sparse, apologies for that.

If you use my package, please leave a star! Your appreciation is my motivation.
If my code helps you with your research, please cite it as follows:
