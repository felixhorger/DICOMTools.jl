DICOMTools.jl
-------------

Additional DICOM functionality build on top of [DICOM.jl](https://github.com/JuliaHealth/DICOM.jl)
(more precisely, a fork [DICOM.jl](https://github.com/felixhorger/DICOM.jl),
where I slightly changed the way data is read in).

Currently, this package grows as needed by my research, so comments and documentation are painfully sparse,
apologies for that.
